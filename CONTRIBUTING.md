## Code Style Guide

* Make it consistant with the existing code.
* Make sure jshint agrees with your code by running ```npm test```.

## Reporting issues
1. Search for existing issues. Your question or bug may have already been answered or fixed (try not to duplicate issues).
2. If possible, try to include a reference to a live example (such as JSFiddle).
